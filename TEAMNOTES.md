  -Things we did: designing the main button look, getting the button to go to the correct link, getting hovering changes to work, keyboard functionality.<br>
  -Things we planned to work on: disabled aspect for the button, making it so the button adjusts its size based on the window size.<br>

	What Did I learn today that we will apply:<br>
  		-We have already updated our button so that it does not have the extra code in here.  After watching you create the button today, we learned more about the specific features of each line of code. 
  <br>
 	What are your next steps:<br>
 		-The next steps we will be refining this further and working more with the demo section. We will be adding more features such as having the button adjust with size, adding the disable feature, and adding an icon.

Today we added icons to our buttons and ironed out some of the issues we were having in the demo. We are now working on getting the disabled aspect to work and looking into the color changing aspects. We plan to watch the recorded video to identify some possible changes we could make to our code.

Peer Review: Jonah and Griffin <br>
- 2 Similarities: styling for the css of the a tag is the same structure as ours; hover styles both change the background color <br>
- 2 Differences: they are currently using a button where we are using an a tag(solution: wrap a tag in a button?); their button contains more elements than ours does because they are using pictures for styling where we are using color changes.   <br>
- Code Snippet that could be used from their project for solution: We would like to use how they wrap their a tag in a button tag for styling and disabling<br>
penguinA.setAttribute(
    'style',
  'text-decoration:none;  opacity: 0.5; pointer-events: none;' <br>
